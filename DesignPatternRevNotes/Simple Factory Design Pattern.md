The Simple Factory Design Pattern is a design approach that employs a single, central factory class to generate objects based
on input parameters. This approach simplifies object creation by hiding the complex instantiation details from client code.
While it's not a traditional Gang of Four design pattern, it's frequently utilized for its simplicity in real-world software development.
Here's a Java code example of the Simple Factory Design Pattern:

```
// Product interface
interface Product {
    void operation();
}

// Concrete products
class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
    @Override
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("Concrete Product A");
    }
}

class ConcreteProductB implements Product {
    @Override
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("Concrete Product B");
    }
}

// Simple Factory
class SimpleFactory {
    public static Product createProduct(String type) {
        if (type.equals("A")) {
            return new ConcreteProductA();
        } else if (type.equals("B")) {
            return new ConcreteProductB();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid product type");
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product productA = SimpleFactory.createProduct("A");
        Product productB = SimpleFactory.createProduct("B");

        productA.operation();
        productB.operation();
    }
}
```
Explanation:

In this example, we have a Product interface with two concrete implementations, ConcreteProductA and ConcreteProductB.

The SimpleFactory class provides a static method createProduct that takes a parameter indicating which product to create and returns an instance of the appropriate concrete product.

The client code uses the SimpleFactory to create Product objects without needing to know the details of their instantiation.

Principles in SOLID:

The Simple Factory Design Pattern does not inherently break any of the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle). However, it has some limitations and considerations:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

The SimpleFactory class is responsible for both creating objects and deciding which object to create. This can be seen as a violation of SRP because it has multiple reasons to change: when new products are added or when the creation logic changes.
Open-Closed Principle (OCP):

Adding a new product requires modifying the SimpleFactory class, which violates the OCP. Ideally, you should be able to add new products without modifying existing code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

The Simple Factory itself does not directly relate to LSP, but it depends on the correct implementation of the Product interface in concrete products. Violations of LSP would occur if the subclasses (concrete products) do not adhere to the expected behavior defined by the interface.
In summary, while the Simple Factory is a simple and widely used design pattern, it may not be suitable for all scenarios, especially when your application needs to adhere strictly to SOLID principles. More advanced creational patterns like the Factory Method or Abstract Factory can provide better support for extensibility and maintainability while respecting these principles.
